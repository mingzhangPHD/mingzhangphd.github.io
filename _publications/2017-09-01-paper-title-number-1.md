excerpt: 'Rolling bearing faults are among the primary causes of breakdown in multistage centrifugal pump. A novel method of rolling bearings fault diagnosis based on variational mode decomposition is presented in this contribution. The rolling bearing fault signal calculating model of different location defect is established by failure mechanism analysis, and the simulation vibration signal of the proposed fault model is investigated by FFT and envelope analysis. A comparison has gone to evaluate the performance of bearing defect characteristic extraction for rolling bearings simulation signal by using VMD and EMD. The result of comparison verifies the VMD can accurately extract the principal mode of bearing fault signal, and it better than EMD in bearing defect characteristic extraction. The VMD is then applied to detect different location fault features for rolling bearings fault diagnosis via modeling simulation vibration signal and practical vibration signal. The analysis result of simulation and experiment proves that the proposed method can successfully diagnosis rolling bearings fault.'
