excerpt: 'Refurbishment and remanufacturing play a vital role in the sustainability of the large industrial field, which aims at restoring the equipment that is close to the end of their life. The EU-funded project RECLAIM proposes new approaches and techniques to support these two activities in order to achieve saving valuable materials and resources by renewing and recycling the mechanical equipment rather than scraping them when they exceed the end of the lifetime. As the most critical part of predictive maintenance in RECLAIM, the fault diagnosis technique could provide the necessary information about the identification of the failure type, thus making suitable maintenance strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel implementation method that can combine the digital twins with the fault diagnosis of large industrial equipment. Experiment result and analysis demonstrate that the proposed framework performs well for the fault diagnosis of rolling bearing.'
