excerpt: 'Industrial equipment/machinery is an important element of manufacturing. They are used for producing objects that people need for everyday use. Therefore, there is a challenge to adopt effective maintenance strategies to keep them well-functioning and well-maintained in production lines. This will save energy and materials and contribute genuinely to the circular economy and creating value. Remanufacturing or refurbishment is one of the strategies to extend life of such industrial equipment. The paper presents an initial framework of cost estimation model based on combination of activity-based costing (ABC) and human expertise to assist the decision-making on best life extension strategy (e.g. remanufacturing, refurbishment, repair) for industrial equipment. Firstly, ABC cost model is developed to calculate cost of life extension strategy to be used as a benchmark strategy. Next, expert opinions are employed to modify data of benchmark strategy, which is then used to estimate costs of other life extension strategies. The developed cost model has been implemented in VBA-based ExcelÂ® platform. A case study with application examples has been used to demonstrate the results of the initial cost model developed and its applicability in estimating and analysing cost of applying life extension strategy for industrial equipment. Finally, conclusions on the developed cost model have been reported.'
